# Salesforce OAuth Integration App

This application integrates with Salesforce using OAuth 2.0 and offers both **data fetching** and **real-time updates via webhooks**. It authenticates users via Salesforce, retrieves and stores their data (including custom fields and metadata), and listens to webhook notifications from Salesforce to keep the database in sync.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔐 OAuth 2.0 Authentication with Salesforce
- 📥 Secure access token and instance URL storage
- 📄 SOQL-based data extraction (including standard & custom fields)
- 📦 Metadata extraction for custom fields
- 🔁 Webhook listener for real-time updates from Salesforce
- 🔄 Automatic parsing of webhook XML → JSON
- 🧠 Intelligent upsert logic to update or insert records in DB
- 🗃️ All retrieved or updated data stored in local database

## ⚙️ Workflow Overview

### 1. **OAuth Authentication**

- `GET /connect`  
  Redirects the user to Salesforce login.
  
- Salesforce returns an authorization code.
- Code is exchanged for:
  - `access_token`
  - `instance_url`
- Tokens are securely stored in the database.

### 2. **Data Fetching from Salesforce**

- Using the `access_token` and `instance_url`, SOQL queries are made.
- Both standard and **custom fields** are fetched.
- Metadata is extracted to understand custom field structure.
- Data is stored in the database.

### 3. **Webhook Integration**

- Salesforce sends webhook (Outbound Message) in **XML format**.
- App listens on a `/webhook` endpoint.
- XML is parsed into JSON.
- Data is **upserted** into the database (insert or update if exists).
- Keeps local DB in sync with Salesforce in near real-time.
